module YAML
  # Explaination from @h4xnoodle:
  #
  # Since ruby 3+ and psych 4+, the yaml loading became extra safe so the
  # expired_at timestamp in the yaml cache is no longer parsing for whatever reason.
  #
  # Attempts were made with
  #
  # `@store = YAML::Store.new path`
  # =>
  # `@store = YAML::Store.new(path, { aliases: true, permitted_classes: [Time] })`
  # to get it to work but that didn't help, so decided to just bypass the safe
  # loading, since the file is controlled by us for the version checking.
  #
  # This is to override the way that psych seems to be loading YAML.
  # Instead of using 'load' which needs work to permit the 'Time' class
  # (which from above I tried that and it wasn't working so I decided to just
  # bypass and use what it was doing before).
  # This brings us back to the equivalent that was working before in that unsafe
  # load was used before the psych upgrade.
  #
  # This change: https://my.diffend.io/gems/psych/3.3.2/4.0.0 
  # is the changes that 'cause the problem' and so I'm 'fixing it' by using the old equivalent.
  # 
  # Maybe the yaml cache needs more work to have 
  # `YAML::Store.new(path, { aliases: true, permitted_classes: [Time] }) work.`
